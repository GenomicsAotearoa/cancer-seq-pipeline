Three step process. 

First is either counting germline or somatic mutations. 
    - germline, script is countGermlineMutations.R
    - somatic is either parrallel or serial counting, so this must be the bigger task. 

Second is a data merge. Bringing data in from Cancer Genome(??) Interface(?) - CGI. 
    - Merge_Auck.data._CGI.R

Third is to generate a report
    -generateReport.R
